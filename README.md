**Web Objects** is a curated collection of interactive web components and practical examples built using React, TypeScript, and Vite. This project serves as a dynamic showcase of modern web development techniques, with a strong emphasis on data visualization and interactive learning experiences, particularly in the realms of Excel and SQL.

## Content Focus

This project is designed to provide hands-on learning and reusable components for the following areas:

*   **Excel Data Visualization:** Explore interactive demonstrations and tools for creating compelling data visualizations from Excel data. Discover practical examples related to Excel 365, advanced charting techniques, and dynamic dashboard creation.
*   **SQL Data Interaction:** Learn how to seamlessly interact with SQL databases and present data in engaging ways. Find components and examples for data querying, filtering, and real-time updates.

## Key Features

*   **Modular React Components:** Build upon a foundation of reusable React components, designed for flexibility and easy integration into your projects.
*   **TypeScript Powered:** Benefit from enhanced code quality, maintainability, and type safety with TypeScript.
*   **Lightning-Fast Vite Development:** Experience rapid development cycles and optimized production builds with Vite.
*   **Seamless Client-Side Routing:** Navigate effortlessly through the application with React Router DOM.
*   **Immersive Full-Screen Mode:** Enable a distraction-free viewing experience with React Full Screen.
*   **Syntax-Highlighted Code Snippets:** Display code examples with clarity and style using React Syntax Highlighter.
*   **Browser Detection:** Adapt the user experience based on the user's browser using Bowser.
*   **Code Quality Assurance:** Maintain consistent code style and prevent errors with ESLint and Prettier.

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd web-objects
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install  # or yarn install
    ```

3.  **Start the Development Server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev # or yarn dev
    ```

    This will launch the application in development mode, typically accessible at `http://localhost:5173/`.

4.  **Build for Production:**

    ```bash
    npm run build # or yarn build
    ```

    This command will create a production-ready build of the application in the `dist` directory.

5.  **Preview Production Build:**

    ```bash
    npm run preview # or yarn preview
    ```

    This command will start a local server to preview the generated production build.

## Available Scripts

*   `dev`: Starts the Vite development server for local development.
*   `check`: Performs type checking and ESLint analysis.
*   `build`: Builds the application for production deployment.
*   `preview`: Starts a local server to preview the production build.
*   `lint`: Lints the code using ESLint and Prettier.
*   `format`: Formats the code using Prettier.
